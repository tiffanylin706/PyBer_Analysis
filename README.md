# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:
Use several types of visualizations(scatter plot grapghs, pie charts and fivethirtyeight graph) to tell a compelling story about the relationship between type of city, and the number of drivers and riders, as well as the percentage of total fares, drivers, and riders by the type of city. 
This analysis will help PyBer improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordabilty for underserved neighborhoods. 
Data: Provided in two .csv files at city and rider level. The two datasets were merged into one which combine the info into one data source.
Tools used: Python Scripts using Pandas Libaries, Juypter Notebook and Matplotlib
